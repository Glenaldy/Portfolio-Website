This was a big project from overseas community to Love Live! Festtm concert. It consists of a giant banner and custom flowerstand.
I was in charge in overall design, banner design and printing related management. 
The banner was created in collaboration by me and artist Chroneco. I created the background and logo design while all the character illustration is created by Chroneco.

The flowerstand illustration was created by multiple artists, details can be found here.
