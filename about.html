          <p>
            My name is Glenaldy Sebastian, I am a student from Indonesia
            currently studying in Kyoto, Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I pursued my studies in design, I admired the power of it to
            communicate the unexplainable to viewers. However, I realized that
            my true passion lies in the possibilities of computers and
            technology and their potential in reaching even greater audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I pursue my third year into my studies, I have self-taught myself
            in my free time some key skills that I believe will be valuable in
            the future such as website development and programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the experiences of design I have accumulated and my systematic
            way of thinking that I have, I am now capable of making design
            decisions that will fulfill the need of my client without any
            compromise to details.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that in mind, I summarized my strong elements into
            <span class="bold">3 points:</span>

        <div id="part2">
          <p>
            <span class="bold">Clean and Neat Design Workflow</span><br />
            I pride myself on an ordered and tidy workflow so that my team can
            join and start working without the burden of a messy work
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">Technology and Computer Enthusiasts</span><br />
            I am a passionate designer obsessed with the latest trends in
            computers and technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">Fast Learning Capability</span><br />
            I am a designer that can quickly adapt to any team environment. I am
            also a quick learner that is not afraid to learn any new tools or
            concepts that can improve my skillset.
